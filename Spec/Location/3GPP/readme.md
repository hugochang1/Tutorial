# TDD
* Use the time division to allocate the radio resouce for different users
* need to have guard band to avoid interference

# FDD

  * use the frequency to allocate the radio resource for different users

  * the same frequency channel need to involve the guard band to avoid interference

# OFDMA

  * combine different users together or orthogonal to eliminate the interference totally
  * when blue line is in peak, the pink and yellow line are in zero points
