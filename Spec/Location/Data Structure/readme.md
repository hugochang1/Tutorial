# Data structures
- arrays
  - An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
  - pros: easy to index the elements
  - cons
    - need to have contiguous memory
    - need to know the maximum size first or it will cause O(N) to allocate and copy from original small size array to big one
- linked lists
  - A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations
  - it contains a head and point to first element
  - an element contains two fields: data and pointer which points to the next elements
  - pros: It's not required to have the contiguous memory location
  - cons
    - required extra memory for pointer field
- stacks
  - Stack is a linear data structure that follows the order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)
  - application: SW function call
- queues
  - A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
- hash
  - Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements.
  - hash-sets (Java)
    - contains unique elements
  - hash-maps (Java)
    - stores values in key-value pair and contains unique keys
    - It can have only one null as key and multiple null as values
    - It is not Thread-Safe because it is not Synchronized but it gives better performance
  - hash-tables (Java)
    - stores values in key-value pair and contains unique keys
    - The null is not allowed for both key and value
    - It is Thread-Safe
  - dictionary (Python)
    - Dictionaries is a data type in Python
    - it likes hash-maps
- trees
  - a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
  - Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree)
  - but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent
- binary trees
  - same as trees except there is a constraint on the number of children for each parent to exactly two
- heaps
  - it's a special binary tree
    - max heap: the value of parents are smaller than their children
    - min heap: the value of parents are greateer than their children
    -  A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority
- graphs
  - consists of a set of vertices, together with a set of pairs of these vertices
