# Terms
- Android Framework
  - It is a layer between Android application and Hardware abstract layer (HAL)
  - It define SDK APIs to Android application layer and design its logical and implementation to handle it to HAL
  - It defines serval different doamin such Location Framework, WiFi Framework, BT Framework, ...etc.
- E911
  - It's short for enhanced 911
  - It's a system used in North America to automatically provide the caller's location to 911 dispatchers
- GPS
  - Global Positioning System maintained by US
  - It provides geolocation and time information to GPS receiver in outdoor
- GNSS
  - Global Navigation Satellite System contains GPS (US), GLONASS (Russia), BeiDou (China), Galileo (EU) and QZSS (Japan)
- AGPS/AGNSS
  - It's short for assisted GPS or assisted GNSS
  - It's a GNSS augmentation system that often significantly improves the startup performance
- Application
  - It's a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself
  - The sample of the application can be the engineer test tool, Google Map, Gmail, ...etc.


# Data structures
- arrays
  - An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
  - pros: easy to index the elements
  - cons
    - need to have contiguous memory
    - need to know the maximum size first or it will cause O(N) to allocate and copy from original small size array to big one
- linked lists
  - A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations
  - it contains a head and point to first element
  - an element contains two fields: data and pointer which points to the next elements
  - pros: It's not required to have the contiguous memory location
  - cons
    - required extra memory for pointer field
- stacks
  - Stack is a linear data structure that follows the order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)
  - application: SW function call
- queues
  - A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
- hash
  - Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements.
- hash-sets
  - contains unique elements
- hash-maps
  - stores values in key-value pair and contains unique keys
  - It can have only one null as key and multiple null as values
  - It is not Thread-Safe because it is not Synchronized but it gives better performance
- hash-tables
  - stores values in key-value pair and contains unique keys
  - The null is not allowed for both key and value
  - It is Thread-Safe
- dictionary
  - Dictionaries is a data type in Python
  - it likes hash-maps
- trees
  - a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
  - Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree)
  - but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent
- binary trees
  - same as trees except there is a constrain the number of children for each parent to exactly two
- heaps
  - it's a special binary tree
    - max heap: the value of parents are smaller than their children
    - min heap: the value of parents are greateer than their children
    -  A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority
- graphs
  - consists of a set of vertices, together with a set of pairs of these vertices

# GPS
- Hot start: all GPS/GNSS assistance data are valid
- Warm start: only ephemeris data is invalid
- Cold start: all GNSS assistance data are invalid
- NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association): it's an ASCII string to represent the location, time and satellite information
  - $GPGGA,055148,2407.8945,N,12041.7649,E,1,00,1.0,155.2,M,16.6,M,X.X,xxxx,*47
    - provide UTC, latitude, Longitude and altitude 
  - $GPGSA,A,3,01,05,09,17,21,2,26,39,,,,1.9,1.0,1.7,*33
    - provide fix type (unavailable, 2D, 3D),  PRN (satellite IDs),  PDOP, HDOP, VDOP
  - $GPGSV,3,1,09,01,27,299,43,………*70
    - provide satellite information such as num of satellite, num of satellite used in location fixed, each satellite's PRN (GPS: 32, Galileo: 36, Beidou: 63, NavIC: 14, QZSS:10, Glonass: 65-96), elevation (0-90), azimuth (0-359), SRN (0-99)

# AGPS tech
- Control Plane (3GPP, RRLP, RRC, LPP, LPPe)
  - RRLP (Radio Resource Location service Protocol): support in 2G for AGPS, CID, ECID
  - RRC (Radio Resource Control): support in 3G for AGPS
  - LPP (LTE Positioning Protocol): support in 4G and 5G for AGNSS and OTDOA
  - LPPe (LPP extension): support in 4G and 5G for Indoor positioning (WiFi, BT, Sensors)
  - User Scenarios
    - MO-LR (Mobile Oriented Location Request)
    - MT-LR (Mobile Terminated Location Request) notification only or verification (yes or no)
    - NI-LR (Network Initiated Location Request) for E911 (no notification and verification)
- User Plane (OMA, SUPL1.0, SUPL2.0)
  - SUPL1.0 (Secure User Plane Location): 
    - User Scenarios
      - SI (SET Initiated)
      - NI (Network Inititated) over OMA Push or SMS
        - no notification and verification, used in E911)
        - notification only
        - verification (yes or no)
  - SUPL2.0 (Secure User Plane Location): support 4G cell, LPP and LPPe
    - compitable with SUPL1.0
    - User Scenarios
      - NI can support over UDP or SIP push
      - Area ID: like geofence but based on PLMN (Public land mobile network) instead, when user enter or leave then it reports
