# I2C
- Inter-Integrated Circuit is a synchronous, multi-master and multi-slave serial communication bus in short-distance, intra-board communication
  - SDA (Serial Clock): it is a clock signal that is driven by the master (idle is in high voltage)
  - SCL (Serial Data): it is a bi-directional data signal that can be driven by either the master or the slave (idle is in high voltage)
    - Standard mode (Sm) 100 kbps
    - Fast mode (Fm) 400 kbps
    - Fast mode plus (Fm+) 1 Mbps
    - High-speed mode (Hs) 3.4 Mbps
  - Master: could be AP, MD, ...etc.
    - Only master can do START condition and STOP condition
    - clock on SCL is generated by master
    - 7-bit slave address
    - Arbitration for Multiple Master
  - Slave: could be sensors, LED, EEPROM, NFC, camera control path, ...etc.
  - I2C operation
    - master writes the data to slave
    - master read the data from slave
  - I3C: Improved Inter Integrated Circuit
    - Two wire serial interface up to 12.5 MHz 
    - Legacy I2C Device co-existence on the same Bus
    - Dynamic Addressing
    - Multi-Master capability (a slave can ask to become a master)
    - In-Band Interrupt (IBI, a slave can notify mater to read the data)
- My job
  - familiar with I2C HW register design
  - maintain I2C driver in bootloader, kernel
    - kernel migration
    - modify I2C driver for new I2C HW design in new chip
  - design and maintain the I2C test code
    - chip verification
