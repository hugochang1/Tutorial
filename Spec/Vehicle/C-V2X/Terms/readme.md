#### WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment)
- a set of communication standards and protocols specifically designed to support wireless communication between vehicles and infrastructure in vehicular environments

#### SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers)
- an international professional association and standards organization that focuses on advancing mobility engineering and related technologies.

#### DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication)
- a wireless communication technology designed for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication in intelligent transportation systems (ITS)

#### BSM (Basic Safety Messages)
- contain the positions, velocities, and other information about the vehicles
- transmitted up to once every 100 ms

#### C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-everything)
- provide real-time, highly reliable, and actionable information flows to enable safety, mobility and environmental applications
- goal
  - improve road safety
  - increase the efficient flow of traffic
  - reduce environmental impacts
  - provide additional communications
  - traveler information services
- 4 types of communications
  - Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
    - mostly for safety and ADAS services
  - Vehicleâ€“to-infrastructure (V2I)
    - allows RSUs (Road Side Unit) to monitor traffic
    - RSUs can be eNodeBs or standalone roadside devices
  - Vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P)
    - safety alerts to pedestrians, bicyclists
    - provides over-the-top cloud services
- 2 interface
  - PC5 interface for V2V, V2I, V2P operating in ITS bands (e.g., 5.9 GHz)
    - direct communications
    - Operates both in-coverage (within eNodeB) and out-of-coverage (without eNodeB)
    - Latency-sensitive use cases
  - Uu interface for V2N
    - Wide area networks communications
    - Leverages existing LTE networks
    - More latency tolerant use cases

### Internet
#### RFC (Request For Comments)
- It is a document series used in computer networking and internet standards development

#### IEFT (Internet Engineering Task Force)
- an open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers who contribute to the development and standardization of protocols and technologies for the internet

--------------------------------------------------------------
### Wireless technologies
#### CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)
- a medium access control (MAC) protocol used in wireless networks, particularly in the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard (Wi-Fi)
- In CSMA/CA, before transmitting data, a device checks if the wireless medium is idle or busy. 
- If it senses the medium is busy, it defers its transmission and waits for a clear channel.
