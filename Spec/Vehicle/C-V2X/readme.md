# overview
### DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communications)
- is a wireless communication technology designed specifically for automotive applications
- V2V, V2I
- operates in 5.9 GHz frequency band
- IEEE 802.11p
- low latency
- range of up to 1000 meters
- used for safety and traffic efficiency applications, such as
  - Collision avoidance
  - Intersection safety
  - Emergency vehicle warning
  - Road hazard warnings
  - Traffic management
### C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything)
- C-V2X leverages cellular networks, such as 4G and 5G, to provide reliable, low-latency, and long-range communication for various automotive applications
- two types of communication
  - Direct communication
    - operates in the 5.9 GHz frequency band
    - V2V, V2I, V2P
  - Network communication
    - V2N (cloud-based services, traffic information, ...etc.)
- applications
  - Safety
  - Traffic efficiency
  - Autonomous driving
  - Smart city integration

# C-V2X applications
