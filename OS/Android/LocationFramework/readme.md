# Geocoder
* A class to transform location coordinate (latitude and longitude) info an address

# GnssAntennaInfo
* GNSS antenna info are measured for each specific device model by device manufactures
* GPS antenna characteristics can be changed such as a device is folded open or closed

# GnssCapabilities
* provide GNSS capabilities such as constellation type (ex: GPS, Galileo, Glonass, Beidou) and their carry frequency
* whether GNSS chip can support Accumulated Delta Range (ADR)
  * ADR measures the change in phase of the carrier wave, ADR is theoretically ~1000x more precise than the pseudorange
