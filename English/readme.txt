Why Ancient Roman Buildings Lasted Longer

1. What are the structures of ancient Rome that have existed for thousands of years a testament of?
This is a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient 
Roman engineers who mastered the use of concrete.

2. What did a team of scientists who analyzed 2,000-year-old concrete samples from the walls of Priverno find?
They found that white lumps in concrete, called “lime crust,”
give concrete the ability to repair cracks that develop over time

3. What did researchers find after an experiment of two concrete samples?
the Roman-style concrete was impermeable,
but the other concrete block was permeable.
